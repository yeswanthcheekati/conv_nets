# conv_nets

### Demonstrates the use of Convolutional Neural Networks for CFD simulations

## Changes
### Use of tanh instead of relu for better accuracy
### Use of Conditional Variational Autoencoders instead of plain CNN
### Ouput is Mach Number instead of x,y components of Velocity

## Additions
### Implementation of Boundary conditions and changes in the simulation accordingly ('u' is an input paramter)
